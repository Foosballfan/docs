# Create a datasource

:::tip
The docs are currently under development
:::

Once you've [logged in](https://app.snaplet.dev/login), create a datasource that allows Snaplet to connect to your database. We never write to your database and recommend that you [create a readonly role](/postgresql/create-read-only-role).

:::tip
Still testing Snaplet? No problem. Use our test database credentials.
```
postgresql://snaplet_readonly:a-very-good-password@db.bmkxarhsomwjwvhhhiqa.supabase.co:6543/postgres
```

## Snapshot worker IP addresses

Snaplet uses the `54.93.75.84` and `18.158.21.101` IP addresses to connect to your database. It's a good idea to restrict all traffic to Postgres and grant access where it's absolutely required!

## Test your database connection

Once you've entered the credentials we'll test them to validate that we have the correct priviledges to be a smooth operator.

## Transform your data...

Now we can copy you're data, but before creating your snapshot, we still need to know how to transform it.
