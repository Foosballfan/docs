This is a work in progress.

:::

Snaplet Cloud Projects are the intersection point between self-hosting Snaplet and using Snaplet's cloud based product.
You can partially or fully adopt Snaplet Cloud Projects based on your requirements.

With Snaplet Cloud Snapshots you can:
- **Snapshot Capture:** Provide credentials to your production or staging server and Snaplet's machines will periodically capture snapshots on a schedule or on demand.
- **Snapshot Storage:** Fully ecrypted snapshot storage to easily share snapshots with your team.
- **Instant database:** Boot up an emphemeral instant database that shuts down when it's no longer in use. It'll boot up (in a few ms) when connected against.
