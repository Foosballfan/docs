# Before we begin...

This section is all about getting started quickly with Snaplet.
We'll run you through a workflow that captures, transforms, and shares a snapshot of your **local development database.**
We're using your local development database because you're currently evaluating Snaplet, and you may not want to test it against your production or staging database! Frankly, we prefer it that way!

Once you're ready to _adopt Snaplet for real_ you can choose to entirely or partly self-host Snaplet in your own environment.

Let's go!
