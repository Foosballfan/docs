# Quickstart

Want to share a snapshot of a database with your team? You're in the right place!
Here we'll create a snapshot of your database, whilst transforming the data, then sharing that snapshot with your team, so that they can restore it into their development environment.

## Capture a snapshot of your database

1. Install Snaplet CLI: `npm install -g @snaplet/cli`
2. Run `snaplet config setup` in the directory with your source code, this creates a configuration file that adjusts variables in the Snaplet CLI
3. Review `.snaplet/transform.ts` and debug it via `snaplet proxy`
4. Once happy, run `snaplet snapshot capture` to get your first snapshot of your database

The snapshot is stored in the `.snaplet/snapshots` directory.
You now have "a nuggest of data üê•" that you can share with you team so that everyone can code against the same database!

## Sharing a snapshot

1. Run `snaplet auth login`
2. Create a project with `snaplet project setup`
3. Run `snaplet snapshot share --message "My first snapshot"`

The snapshot is uploaded to your project and ready to be restored by your team.

## Restoring a snapshot

1. Add the `.snaplet` folder to your repository
2. Invite members to your team [where]
3. Run `snaplet snapshot restore`

## What's next...

The example above is slightly contrived since you've captured a snapshot of your local development database and your team may not want to code against that.
You may want to capture from production or staging, so that the snapshots are an accurate reflection of the data your code runs against.

1. Read our step-by-step "Getting started guide"
2. Capture snapshots in CI/CD [Coming soon...]
3. Learn about reducing the size of your snapshot via subsetting [Coming soon...]
4. Generate data [Coming soon...]
