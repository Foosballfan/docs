# Install CLI

Snaplet is a command line utility that captures snapshots of a database that can be shared with a team, so that everyone can code against the same database.

If you have npm, you can install the CLI from the command line, run:

```bash
npm install -g @snaplet/cli
```

If not, you can run the install script:

```bash
curl -sL https://app.snaplet.dev/get-cli/ | bash
```
